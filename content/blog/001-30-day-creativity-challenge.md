title: "Day 1: My 30 Day Creativity Challenge"

It's January 2019. Today, I started a personal challenge: a six-week New Years Nutrition Challenge.

1. Eat Real Food
1. Not Too Much
1. Get Enough Sleep
1. Drink Enough Water
1. Get Enough Movement

I won't go in depth with this challenge right now. But as I approached this, I started to wonder, "What am I going to do with all my time that I will have not snacking on sugar and booze?" _A question we all ask, right?_

So I'm starting a **30 day creativity challenge**. I feel like creativity is lacking in my life. When I work on something creative — writing, music, building side projects — I get a sense of fulfillment rivaled by nothing.

The issue is that I rarely set aside time to do creative things. Occasionally, I'll get sucked into a side project and be super into it for a couple weeks — but that always fades and I get distracted.

By doing 30 days of creative activities, and documenting them here, I'm hoping to feel more fulfilled. Maybe I'll discover some new things about myself or create some new projects I can dig into the rest of the year.

Keep coming back each day, if you give a shit. Or maybe every few days. It will probably be mostly blog posts, to be honest.
