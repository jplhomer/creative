- Co-founder of Zeit, company responsible for Hyper terminal, Next.js SSR React framework, Now serverless deployments, and much more
- Zeit excites me about modern infrastucture and developer experience. Same feeling I had about DigitalOcean whent it first arrived on the scene, which lowered the bar to regular folks like me spinning up a private virtual server.
- He posts the latest and greatest JS thinking from super smart people.
- Zeit as a company pushes the limits. PKG, NCC, React, product thinking and cycle of Now.
- They have a [team of heavy-hitters](https://zeit.co/about): folks who have created or actively contribute to popular open-source frameworks like socketio, mongoose, Node.js core, Storybook, Kap, and more.

- She co-founded an image compression company called Binomial
- First heard her on the Indie Hackers podcast https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/044-stephanie-hurlburt-of-binomial
- She is so positive and warm, tweeting really helpful information to folks in tech, especially geared toward underrepresented groups
- Very transparent about business dealings, and what it's like to be someone technical going out and selling a successful product
- Inspires me to build my own product someday and have the autonomy and choices she has
- Also is open about mental health, relationships and networking; and has shared that she suffers from PTSD from a traumatic experience in her past.

## Ives van Hoorne

- Created [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io), the go-to online IDE for front-end JS projects. Started out as a React sandbox, but has since added templates for Vue, Angular, Vanilla JS, and server-side evaluated projects like GraphQL servers.
- The entire [front-end of CodeSandbox is open-source](https://github.com/CompuIves/codesandbox-client/). I've learned a ton by looking through it. The tech nitty-gritty: he's found a way to compile scripts and import assets _on the client side_ using Web Workers. Super clever. But he's also put a lot of thought into building the editor. Recently, he wrote an integration to use literal VS Code (also open-source) as the editor. ðŸ¤¯ https://twitter.com/CompuIves/status/1052594462768148480
- He tweets positive stuff, and shares cool things the community has created
- He's only 22 years old!

## Sara Soueidan

- She is a developer, consultant, and speaker speaker who is widely-regarded as the go-to SVG and CSS expert
- Her Twitter feed is a nice combination of SVG/CSS thinking and tips, article recommendations and career advice
- I appreciate that she is willing to stand up for an idea and offer positivity, where the state of Twitter tends to be constant negativity or dunking/slamming the bad features of a product: https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1075380056174796800
- She's also honest and humble about her skills, which is great for beginners and newcomers to see experts also struggle sometimes https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1080539255427031041

## Dan Abramov

I don't know why it took me so long to follow Dan. He's just a super intelligent guy.

- Core contributor to React
- His writing is concise and informative. I learn so much whenever I read stuff written by him.
- His tweets trend positive in nature and share new ideas within the community
- He just started a blog [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io) which explores lots of technical details of React's implementation, in addition to general career stuff.

## Jessie Frazelle

I started following Jessie back when I was the sole developer working at an ad agency. I sought out inspiration from other development shops, and stumbled upon [Barrel's website](https://www.barrelny.com/). After scrolling through their team bios, I found Jessie and her Twitter feed. I must have chosen to follow her on a whim â€” maybe because she had an entire library of copy/pastable PHP scripts for things like taking screenshots of websites and hooking into the Facebook API. You know, stuff that would have made sense to use when I was at an ad agency.

Jessie left the agency world shortly after I started following her, and she started tweeting about this new thing called [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and containers. Like, super nerdy and in-depth thing about Linux and shells and security and stuff I couldn't even imagine knowing.

She eventually started working at Docker, then Google, Microsoft, and now GitHub. She's regarded as one of the tech world's container experts and often has really great writing about all things containers. Her Twitter feed is positive, too!
